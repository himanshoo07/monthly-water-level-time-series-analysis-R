# monthly-water-level-time-series-analysis-R

This report is regarding studying, analyzing, and drawing the conclusions of the pond data which is given to us which consists of the water levels measured on the monthly basis from 1966 to 2015 in a small pond in Hampshire. Based on studying the data we have tried to find out different constituents of the time series to eventually get rid of them (like trend & seasonality).

Furthermore, we went on to study which model would be the most appropriate fit for our data. Based on these studies, various patterns & graphs we went on to check whether the moving average model, white noise or the auto regression model would be the best fit. These studies, plotting of several graphs & inferring from them took us to our conclusions about the best model for our data. In order to further analyze the data, periodograms are being made of the raw data as well as of the residuals once the different components are removed such as trend and seasonality and fitting of the appropriate model based on our studies & inference.

The complete model would then be obtained for our time series X after our all of the analysis is done which will incur the estimated coefficients calculated when the models were being fit. This model would be useful to predict the water levels in pond in the upcoming years.
